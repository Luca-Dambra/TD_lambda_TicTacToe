# TD_lambda_board_games

This reposity contains the code of the two game-learning programs, one for the game of Tic-Tac-Toe and one for the game of Connect-4, that I have presented in my master's thesis. 

Those programs consist in a neural network that trains itself to be an evaluation function of the various positions of the games. 

The parameter of the neural network are updated using the reinforcement learning algorithm called TD(lambda).


Most of the code in this reposity is based on the works of Daniel Slater ([AlphaToe](https://github.com/DanielSlater/AlphaToe)) and
Fomoro Company Organization ([TD-gammon](https://github.com/fomorians/td-gammon)).
